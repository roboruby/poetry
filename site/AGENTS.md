# AGENTS.md — poetry-docs

The docs site and standing fresh-app install proof: a Rails app (importmap +
tailwindcss-rails + propshaft, no ActiveRecord, no Node) consuming the poetry
gems as path-pinned siblings. Gallery + Demos + `/theming` with the nine-theme
switcher.

## Commands

- `bin/rails test` — includes the whole-gallery gates (every catalog page
  must 200 AND carry ≥1 example)
- `bin/rails tailwindcss:build` — REQUIRED after any change that affects
  scanned classes (new pages, new examples, gem fragment changes)
- `ruby script/build_style_registry.rb` — regenerate the nine wrapped
  `.style-<name>` theme files after ANY gem fragment change, then rebuild CSS
- Dev server convention: port 4100 (`bin/rails server -p 4100 -d`;
  pid in `tmp/pids/server.pid`)

## Conventions

- Pages are registry-driven: add entries via DocsCatalog; the sidebar, ⌘K
  palette, and both whole-gallery gates pick new pages up automatically.
- Examples are self-contained partials riding the shared Preview/Code tabs;
  the example frame is ITSELF a line-variant poetry_tabs — scope any
  automated queries to the demo's own group, never the first
  `.cn-tabs-trigger` on the page.
- Exactly ONE `style-<name>` class lives on `<html>` at all times
  (server-rendered `style-default`, pre-paint localStorage swap). Never ship
  an unscoped visual theme layer.

## The one hard rule

**Never re-run `poetry:install` here.** It would re-inject the
`style-default.css` slot imports into the Tailwind entry, and an unscoped
visual layer leaks omitted-token defaults through the scoped style registry
(see the warning comment in `app/assets/tailwind/application.css`). To
refresh the AGENTS.md pointer section alone, use `bin/rails g poetry:agents`.

## Building UI with poetry (64 components + 13 chart components)

- Compose with the `poetry_*` helpers; never hand-write `cn-*` classes, raw
  hex/oklch colors, or off-scale arbitrary values - tokens and variants carry
  the design.
- Machine catalog: `/poetry/llms.txt` (index) and `/poetry/llms-full.txt`
  (full contracts + Stimulus wiring: targets / values / actions / events).
- Verify markup before finishing: `bin/rails poetry:check` (unknown
  components/slots/variants/wiring, did-you-mean, `--json`).
- One visual theme per app (chosen at install with `--theme`); components
  read tokens, never restate them.
